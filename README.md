# The Dataset and Introduction
The dataset is obtained from TMDb and contains data about movies from multiple years. The data is wrangled by dropping all unnecessary columns to make the analysis easier. Four questions were posed which were inspired from the data set, and they were addressed based on the analysis.
# Summary of The Findings 
According to the data, a movie with a longer runtime is more probable to have a higher rating. A higher budget does not result in a more popular film, but the data shows it is the other way round. Revenues generated from movies have decreased over the years which would imply that less people are watching movies now, but this conclusion does not make logical sense so further exploration is required. Finally, a highest revenue is generated when the budget and the runtime of the movie are in the middle, not too large and not too small.
